All of the combinations...

  no clipping
  no wires above threshold -> Position = 0.
  1 wire above threshold -> position = wire position
  2 consecutive wires above threshold -> Pick third wire on opposite side of max wire and set it equal to threshold.. fit with gaussian
  3 consecutive wires above threshold -> Gaussian fit

  Clipping...
  1 clipped wire 
     - no others above thresh -> Position = Clipped wire position
     - 1 other neighbor above thresh -> Set wire on opposite side to threshold, fit with gaussian using clipped wire with signal 4096
     - 2 neighbors -> Use clipped wire and fit with gaussian
     - 3 neighbors -> fit these three wires with gaussian

  2 clipped wires
     - no others above thresh -> Position = average of two wires position
     - 1 other neighbor above thresh -> add wire above thresh to neighbor, gaussian fit of all three
     - 2 other neighbors above thresh -> 2 wires plus average of clipped wires with height 4096*1.25
     - 3 neighbors above thresh -> Gaussian fit of three wires

  More than 2 clipped wires
     - average of clipped wires positions


  Steps
     - Calculate number of wires above threshold, and put them in trigger** vector
     - If none are above threshold, set nClipped=0, move on
     - If one is above threshold, set position to this point, check if it clipped
     - If two are above threshold
         - check for max and position of max
	 - check for clipping, 
	 - if both clipped, position is average of two wires
	 - else pick one more wire on opposite side of lower wire, set it to 100. 
	     - If max is edge wire, pick "ghost" wire outside outer wire, set it to 100.
	 - and fit with gaussian
     - If three or more are above threshold
         - Check for max
         - Check them for clipping
	 - No Clipping -> Fit max and two neighbors with gaussian, if max is edge wire, use the two wires inside the plane
	 - 1 Clipped -> use clipped wire and fit the three with gaussian, if edge is clipped, use the two wires in the plane
	 - 2 Clipped 
	     - 1 other above thresh -> add wire above thresh to it's clipped neighbor, gaussian fit of all three. 
	     - 2 others above thresh -> 2 wires plus average of clipped wires with height 4096*1.25
	     - 3 others above thresh -> use 3 wires in gaussian fit
	 - 3 or more clipped
	     - 3 others above thresh -> Fit with gaus
	     - Else average clipped wires
