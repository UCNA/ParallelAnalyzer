18749 Has a residual of -146.109 on the Bismuth peak. This is also a reference run so I'm not sure 
	what would cause something like this. There is a note in our run log here at UK which says 
	the Bi pulser peak is very spread out and the lower and upper peaks are indistinguishable.
	Is this a reason to get rid of PMTW4 for run period 7?

Removing PMTW4 from run period 7...

19232 I believe is way off the chart at least on the west side... I'll check into this

For Run period 4, I am only using runs 17871-17922 as these were normal calibration run. After 
	17922 the runs become long runs with the sources not being moved.

17874 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
17877 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
17893 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
17903 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
17904 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
17917 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
17892 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
17918 - removed from EPMT2 due to Ce peak being too low to distinguish
